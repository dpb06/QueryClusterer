Programming order and checklist:



Still todo:

Check all of the below is in place
(using test code, don't bother with full)

In Query
	+have done getting distributions for all words in query
	+have done comparing all distributions together
	-need to cluster closest values
	-need to compare clusters Distr with Word Distr
	-need to compare cluster Distr with cluster Distr
	-need to be able to merge Word/Word -> cluster
	-need to be able to merge Word/Cluster -> cluster
	-need to be able to merge Cluster/Cluster -> cluster
	-need to be able to store Words and Clusters in the same list, (in order of strongest)
	-need to have a list of Currently looked at (those that will be compared and merged)
	
	-Need to pick M distrs initially(strongest)
	- need to merge closest distrConts into cluster
	-  need to replace closest 2 with cluster and next strongest distr
	-   need to merge closest distrConts into cluster

i) 		Read Catagories
ii) 	Read Queries
iii)	Enrich Queries -> Words



1) 		Word 		-Measure(C_all)-> 		Distribution

			For all Words (w)
				For each Category (c)
					w.Dist.set((c.id), m(c, w))
				

2) 		Distribution && other distributions -KLDistr-> Difference (for M strongest Distributions)
		-- Store all comparisons
		-- only compare new distributions again, stored shouldn't be re-worked out
		-give each Dist a method that works out strongest Distributions (see 6 for strength possibilitie)
			

3) 		Merge Closest 2 Distributions -> Cluster(cl) (distribution)
		-- Remove 2 dists from stored comparisons
		-- compare cl with all other distributions stored in comparisons
		-- store cl comparisons

4)		Add Another Distribution(d), New cluster(cl)
		-- compare with all distributions with stored comparisons(including cl)
		
5) 		Repeat from step 2

6) 		When all distributions are worked out choose the cluster with the largest peak confidence
		(the most dist in there, or possibly highest average, maybe highest high peak)
		This will be used as the Dist for the Query.
