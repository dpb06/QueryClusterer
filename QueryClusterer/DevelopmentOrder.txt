Programming order and checklist:


i) 		Read Catagories
ii) 	Read Queries
iii)	Enrich Queries -> Words



1) 		Word 		-Measure(C_all)-> 		Distribution

2) 		Distribution && other distributions -KLDistr-> Difference (for M strongest Distributions)
		-- Store all comparisons
		-- only compare new distributions again, stored shouldnt be re-worked out

3) 		Merge Closest 2 Distributions -> Cluster(cl) (distribution)
		-- Remove 2 dists from stored comparisons
		-- compare cl with all other distributions stored in comparisons
		-- store cl comparisons

4)		Add Another Distribution(d), New cluster(cl)
		-- compare with all distributions with stored comparisons(including cl)
		
5) 		Repeat from step 2

6) 		When all distributions are worked out choose the cluster with the largest peak confidence
		(the most dist in there, or possibly highest average, maybe highest high peak)
		This will be used as the Dist for the Query.
